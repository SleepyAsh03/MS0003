## Course Aims
In today's era of Information, ‘Data’ is the new driving force, provided we know how to extract
relevant ‘Intelligence’. This course will start with the core principles of Data Science, and will equip
you with the basic tool and techniques of data handling, exploratory data analysis, data
visualization, data-based inference, and data-focussed communication. The course will also
introduce you to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence – state space representation,
uninformed search, and reinforcement learning.

The course will motivate you to work closely with data and make data-driven decisions in your
field of study. The course will also touch upon ethical issues in Data Science and Artificial
Intelligence, and motivate you to explore the cutting-edge applications in Materials Science
related to Big Data, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Python will be the language of choice
to introduce hands-on computational techniques.
